PHP7 in Docker with Nginx and Supervisor
========================================

Small example to run PHP in docker with nginx and Supervisor.
I was inspired by https://github.com/makasim/docker-nginx-php-fpm-supervisor

Run `make` to build the docker container and `make run` to start. 

Visit http://localhost:8080 to call `app/app.php``
